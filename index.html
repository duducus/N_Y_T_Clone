                <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a
                  year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
                  world of known physics.

                  He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
                  the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
                  in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
                  exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
                  violent instant.

                  If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and
                  not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                  Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

                  “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
              </p>
              <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
                  Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right. Reaching back across
                  13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
                  astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
                  fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently
                  apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
                  long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
                  correct.</p>

          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
          wondered whether it could ever be proved.  If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a
          landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart,
          or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
          with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
          extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
          endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond
          the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
          ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s
          theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
          said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and
          preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
          Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
          here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

        <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
        <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

        <img class="chart" src="img/img2.png" alt="chart"/>

        <div class="row1-text1">
          <p><strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong>  is just under 14 billion years old.
            From our position in the Milky Way galaxy,
            we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look,
            the universe has an even temperature.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row1-text2">
          <p>
            <strong>ENOUGH TIME </strong>The universe is 
            not old enough for light to have 
            traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, 
            and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row1-text3">
          <p> <strong>DISTANT COFFEE </strong> At a smaller scale, 
            imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. 
            You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, 
            you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row1-text4">
          <p> <strong> COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>   Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. 
            You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. 
            But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row2-text1">
          <p><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, 
            all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row2-text2">
          <p><strong>INFLATION </strong>solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. 
            Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row2-text3">
          <p><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. 
            These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row2-text4">
          <p><strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. 
            And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
    
            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
    
            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
    
            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.
